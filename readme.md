# Widgets

## widget - rf2_server
background communication widget

* a must have background widget (that serve all other widget)
* it do all the communication to the FC
* should be installed on the topbar
* replace the original rf2bkg script
* replace the original rf2tlm script 
* new technology that detect elrs custom telemetry at correct order is already built-in (so no special procedure is needed for sensor discovery)

So, no need to define any scripts in special-function or custom-script anymore.
